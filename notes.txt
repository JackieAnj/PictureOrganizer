-Added mostly empty methods to starter codes
-Removed temporary file Temp.java

Editor: Jesse
TimeStamp: 11/15/17 3:07PM

Changes/How it works:
-Coded the methods and added javadoc to Image and Tag classes
-Formatted the code for better readability with comments
-Grouped related code together (getters/setters)
!!Add/Remove Functions were coded!!

Why: Skeleton was there, but code wasn't implemented yet

Possible Issues:
-someone might want to double check the logic in adding/removing methods in Image; it's a little confusing since we are managing previous and current tags

TimeStamp: 11/14/17 7:16PM

Changes/How it works:
-Created 1 class and 1 fxml file for GUI (Controller.java application.fxml)
-Changes made to GUI/Main.java in order to begin building user interface

Why: To begin the user interface.

Possible Issues:
Since some methods in other classes are incomplete, we are unable to run
the main method for the user interface. As a result we are unable to
view changes made to the user interface thus far.

-remove() for ArrayLists can remove specific Object instead of at an index
!!Add/Remove Functions were fixed!!

Why: old way works, but isn't efficient
